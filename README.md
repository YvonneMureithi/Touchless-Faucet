# Touchless-Faucet

## A Touchless Faucet with a Door Control System that uses an Ultrasonic Sensor, a Servo motor, a Relay, a Submersible Pump, a Potentiometer and an LCD

## Project Statement

The project involves coming up with a proof-of-concept touchless faucet with a door control system that has one washing or santizing 
their hands before accessing a building or room and afterwards accessing the said room via a door that opens automatically. This 
therefore helps one reduce coming into contact with a contaminated sureface, i.e. the door.
